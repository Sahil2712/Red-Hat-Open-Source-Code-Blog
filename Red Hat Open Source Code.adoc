= Red Hat Open Source Code

Project Start Date - 31/03/2020

In RHOSC I have worked on the task "Conversion of Microservice session Application From
Thorntail to Qurarkus" and on making a pull request to the Eclipse project.

The project was divided into 6 subtasks:

== The first task was to install maven on Windows and to create and build an application using Maven

I was running the maven using `mvn clean install`. From this, I came to know what
happens when we use `mvn clean install`. `mvn clean` cleans the project by
removing `{project-directory}/target` and `mvn install` builds the project i.e creates everything 
in the `target` directory and installs it into my local repository. Then I learned to run it
using `mvn` in Eclipse IDE and I got the output successfully as I expected (`HelloWorldThorntail!`).
After this task, I approached my mentor Martin. He taught me how internally Maven
build (`clean install`) works and what happens after that when we run a Maven
application. In this, I got to know about the dependencies in Maven.


== The second task is to learn about git and GitHub

I knew about `git` and GitHub so it didn’t take much time for me to learn some
new concepts.

:third-task-section-name: The third task was to fork the microprofile conference project from \
Eclipse foundation’s repository and then to build the microservice session application 
== {third-task-section-name}

In this initially, I faced many difficulties while building microservice
session application. I was building whole microprofile conference project instead of
the microservice session and there was an error in `web-app` module due to which I
thought that whole build failed then I approached Martin and he shared with
me some resources to learn like getting started with Thorntail application
and the evaluation of enterprise java which helped me to know more about the
working of Thorntail, how to build an application and about the runnable jar in
the `target` directory. Then also due to the same reason, I couldn’t get it.
Then I had a meeting with Martin where he told me about the Maven
dependencies and told me about how to execute a demo application. I built the
demo application and I was able to run it. After that I tried building the
`microservices-session` application and I was able to run the application and
got the expected output. It took me around 4 days to figure it out but I was
able to explore and learn more about Maven.
    
I executed the `microservice-session` in the following sequences:
   
   *   `mvn clean install`
   *   `java -jar target/microservice-session-thorntail.jar`

== The fourth task was to get started with Quarkus i.e creating the first application

I learned through Quarkus blog about creating the first application.

As I was using Windows OS I was getting errors due to the commands when running
the application. So I tried running quarkus application using the vscode and it
was pretty much helpful and got to know the difference between Quarkus and
Thorntail and their dependencies.

I have completed this task in 3 days as I was having an exam one day. I had to
skip that day.

== The fifth task was to convert the `microservices-session` application to Quarkus

In this task, I faced a lot of difficulties because of dependencies.
The main thing I need to do was to change in the parent `pom.xml` and then reflect
it in the `microservice-session`’s `pom.xml` file but I was changing everything in
`microservice-session`’s `pom.xml` i.e replacing Thorntail dependencies with Quarkus
and changing the version.

Then I learned through dependencies about the blog which Martin shared with me.
But I didn’t understand it completely so he arranged a meeting and explain the
dependencies to me.

Then I was able to reflect the changes in parent’s `pom.xml` file and
`microservice-session`’s `pom.xml` file. It was building successfully with no errors
but it was giving me 404 not found error and 500 internal server error due to not including
the Quarkus `resteasy-jsonb` extension dependency.

Then we had a meeting where he taught me about JSON REST services, how 404, 500
and 200 HTTP responses work and how changing REST paths affects leads to errors.

Then I was able to complete it soon and successfully got 200 ok as HTTP
response.

The main reason I was getting 404 or 500 HTTP responses was that I didn’t add
the `resteasy-jsonb` extension dependency. After adding it, I got the expected
output.

== The sixth task was to make a pull request

I knew about how to make the pull request and completed it but then I got the
review to have one commit instead of multiple commits.

Then I came to know about squashing and force push.

After that I broke down the whole application because of pushing application in
different path instead of master but I was able to correct it.

Then had some fun before merging it to the repository like making it to multiple
commits again but I completed the task and I was able to get it merged
completely.

== Experience 

Experience In RHOSC was fun and full of learning. I didn't know
anything about maven but Martin helped me and taught me about new technologies
which helped me to upgrade my knowledge. I hope I get the same mentor as Martin.
He is one of the best mentors ever had and supported and taught me in a best
manner. I hope I get a chance to work again with him.

I think there need not to be any change in the RHOSC as it was well planned and 
executed really well.

Thanks for the opportunity.
